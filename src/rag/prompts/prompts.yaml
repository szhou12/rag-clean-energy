        Given a chat history and the latest user question which might reference context in the chat history, 
        formulate a standalone question which can be understood without the chat history. 
        Do NOT answer the question, just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is.
        根据聊天记录和最新的用户问题，请将最新的用户问题重新表述为一个可以在没有聊天记录的情况下理解的独立问题。
        不要回答问题，只需要重新表述即可。如果没有必要重新表述，则原样返回问题。
